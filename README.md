# lendahand
Lend a Hand is a tool to connect NGOs and non-profits with volunteers from within the community. This service aims to help community members find ways to serve their city while also giving organizations a platform to advertise their volunteer opportunities. Made with ❤️by Fianko, Caden, and Udo.
